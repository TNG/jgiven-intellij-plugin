JGiven Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA
===============================

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) plugin to support both navigating between scenario states and
 finding usages of scenario states within [JGiven](http://jgiven.org/) test stages.

Features
--------

* All scenario states with usages are annotated<br/>
![Line Marker Preview](README/lineMarker.png)

* When looking for usages of a scenario state field, IntelliJ will also show all other fields referencing this scenario state.
 To make those lists more readable, an additional usage type for JGiven scenario states is available.
 Within this list, all non scenario state usages can be filtered out by clicking the JGiven icon.<br/>
